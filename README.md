# FINAL WORK

## This took way too long

4. j. Validate that each Labeled row contains the correct information.

I intepreted this point as not just checking if the table contains certain values, but making sure the table is not shuffled, like this:

| Label| Values |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Student Name | Music |
| Gender | email@gmail.com |
| Hobbies | NCR Delhi |

And like god damn that sh*t was HARD. I spent 4 hours trying all kinds of complicated solutions that didn't work until i found out one that did and it was damn simple. Go figure.

### Note
I considered moving the helper function out of the test file, but decided against it. They are tightly coupled with the the spec, so splitting up the code would give no real benefit.
